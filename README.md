‚≠ê Created using MERN Stack, FetchBook aims to create a central catalog of new and used books so that buyer does not have to go through the hassle of visiting multiple bookstores, and calling multiple sellers for their book needs. <br><br>
‚≠ê It simplifies this entire process significantly, as user can simply check our website for any book they want, filter it by various tags (*new/used, discounted books, sorting by price and seller etc.*) and place an order for that book.<br><br>
**Because we serve as a catalogue, locating books becomes much easier for the user, and you may end up saving one phone call (or tenü§†) to the vendor(s).**<br>

This will also increase bookstore revenue and benefit students who prefer used books (due to them being cheaper than brand new books).
